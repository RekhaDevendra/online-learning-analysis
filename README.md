# Case Studies on Online Learning Platforms
Analysis of Online Learning Platforms' Impact on Student Engagement

# Project Overview
This document contains two case studies that analyze the effectiveness of online learning platforms in enhancing user engagement and academic success. The case studies examine key performance metrics, conduct root cause analysis, and propose business impact strategies to improve user experience.

# Case Study #1: Evaluating the Impact of Online Learning Platforms on Student Engagement and Academic Success

* Focuses on key metrics affecting online learning, such as user engagement, course quality, assessment effectiveness, technological accessibility, instructor support, and feedback mechanisms.
* Includes a Fishbone Diagram Analysis to categorize essential factors influencing platform effectiveness.
* Provides a Data Collection Plan outlining how each metric is measured and the potential risks involved.

# Case Study #2: Enhancing User Engagement on an Online Education Platform (EduLearn)
* Investigates a decline in user engagement and course completion rates.
* Implements the 5-Whys Root Cause Analysis to identify issues related to content interactivity, instructor engagement, platform usability, and course relevance.
* Develops a Dashboard to visualize key metrics such as user engagement rate, course completion rates, and platform usability.
* Analyzes the Business Impact of engagement improvements on retention and revenue growth.
